Lets first examine the decimal system

3      2   	1
10^2   10^1	10^0

comparing binary to decimal, we only use numbers '1' and '0' and every step forward the power of 2 increases instead of 10

1       0  	1  	0  	1  	0  	1  	0
2^7	2^6	2^5	2^4	2^3	2^2	2^1	2^0

we sum every step that has the value 1 which in this example is equal to

2^7 + 2^5 + 2^3 + 2^1 = 170
